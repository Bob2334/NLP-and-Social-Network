We created a chatbot implemented in TensorFlow based on the seq2seq model, with certain rules integrated.We built a persona whose name is Florance. She is a 23 years old young lady from York, England and now studies in Singapore Management University in her third year. Her favourite sport is tennis and she likes to visit Singapore Zoo. She likes pizza and French fries. Meanwhile, she enjoys playing the classical piano music.
The core of our model is based on the NMT model, which has been adjusted here to meet the needs of chatbots. The attention mechanism is  Luong-style and it uses GRU for the hidden units.
