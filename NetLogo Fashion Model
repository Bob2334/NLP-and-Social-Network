In this model, we attempt to build a model for “Fashion”, which is a concept that can be easily described at the aggregate level, yet very difficult (if not impossible) to come up with precise definitions. Taken from Wikipedia, “Fashion is a popular style or practice, especially in clothing, footwear, accessories, makeup, body, or furniture. Fashion is a distinctive and often habitual trend in the style in which a person dresses. It is the prevailing styles in behavior and the newest creations of textile designers.” However, it not easily to describe exactly how fashions are formed, we thus are interested in creating an agent-based model to experiment on factors that might contribute to fashion formation.

Task 1: Create the NetLogo “Fashion” Model
To create a NetLogo model for Fashion, we come up with the following assumptions:
1. To quantify “Fashion”, we assume that each individual in the fashion industry possess a “special knowledge”, which is represented by a 2D coordinates (x and y).
2. Some agents are of “higher status” and all other agents are motivated to gain status by following high- status agents (i.e., copying their knowledge). However, status is also a function of rarity: an agent cannot maintain its high status if there are too many other agents with similar knowledge.
3. Finally, we assume that agents with highest status will want to “preserve” their status by making innovations. In other words, they will want to make some local movement in order to avoid being crowded out by the lower-status followers.
With these assumptions, we are now ready to design the Fashion model. The Fashion model is a 2D surface where each point represents a particular set of Fashion knowledge. Although it is oversimplifying to represent fashion knowledge using only a 2D surface, it allows fashion dynamics to be visualized easily.
When agents move in the knowledge space, it represents its change in knowledge (or its chosen fashion position). Therefore, if an agent imitates another agent, it would be viewed as “moving toward” that agent in the knowledge space; whereas if an agent innovates and comes up with new knowledge that other agents lack, it would be viewed as “moving away” from other agents into previously unoccupied space.
Agents are initially distributed randomly on the surface. Agents have no memory of their own or other agents’ previous positions. The Fashion model should progress iteratively, and in each iteration each agent does the following (refer to Figure 2 for agent’s parameters):
• It counts number of agents in its immediate neighborhood (within its “local radius”).
• If the count is above the given “threshold”, the agent feels crowded (it considers itself as having high
status) and will move in opposite direction from the most crowded spot within its “visible radius”. The most crowded spot is determined by finding another agent with most agents surrounding it (within its local radius).
• If the count is below the given threshold, the agent feels lonely (it considers itself as having low status), and it will move toward the most crowded spot within its visible radius (determined the same way as previously).
• In both cases above, the distance moved should be determined uniformly randomly between 1 and a given “speed” parameter.
From the above description, we can see that an agent’s behavior is controlled by four parameters: 1) local-radius, 2) visible-radius, 3) threshold, and 4) speed. For simplicity, we assume that these four parameters are the same for all agents and are to be set using sliders in the interface.
For visualization purpose, when agents are in “high status” (i.e., feeling crowded), they should be colored “red”; otherwise, if they are in “low status” (i.e., feeling lonely), they should be colored “green”. For smooth visualization, the size of the world should be at least 61 by 61. Try to put at least 500 agents in your model.

Task 2: Measuring Fashion Formation
As shown in the model, fashion formation is dynamic and decentralized: there could be multiple fashion trends co-existing at the same time, and the size and the location (in the knowledge space) of each fashion trend could change all the time. Design and implement a set of measurements that can be used to describe ongoing fashion trends. These measurements should disclose information on:
• The diversity of ongoing fashion trends.
• The strength of each fashion trend.
• The distribution of agent’s status.
We prefer “real-time” measurements. But if this is not possible, we can also accept “off-line” measurements, which are to be computed based on a snapshot of the model (you have to define what this is). However, in either case, you should clearly define how these measurements are to be computed, and explain how your measurements answer the above three questions. You should also try to automate the computation of these measurements as much as possible. Provide a clear guideline on how these measurements are to be computed if it’s not directly shown in the model interface.
With these measurements, comment on your Fashion model; do you think it captures the essence of fashion? What’s missing? How can you further improve the model?
